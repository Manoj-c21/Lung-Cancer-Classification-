# Lung-Cancer-Classification-
Welcome to the Lung Cancer Classification repository. This project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques to predict cancer types based on medical images. The system is powered by a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and deployed using Streamlit, providing users the ability to upload medical images and receive predictions with a probability distribution displayed in a pie chart.
